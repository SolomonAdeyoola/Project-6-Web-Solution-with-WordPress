WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

The project execution is segmented into 2:

1. Storage subsystem configuration (working with disks, partitions and volumes) for web and database servers based on Linux OS. 

2. Installation of WordPress and its connection to a remote MySQL database server further driving home the concept of Web deployment and database tiers of web solution
